Actually this is not a dijkstra algorithm, but it is a solution of 'uniform cost search' task.
The difference is that in dijkstra algorithm, all distances goes to the queue in the beginning,
and then priorities of processed nodes changes.
In my solution I add distances to the queue, as algorithm goes. This is the main difference.
